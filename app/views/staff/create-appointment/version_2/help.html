          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Equipment you need</h2>
          <p>You'll need the following:<p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>a computer, laptop, smartphone or tablet with a microphone and camera</li>
              <li>Google Chrome or Safari web browser
              <li>internet access – we suggest you use WiFi to avoid mobile data charges</li>
            </ul>
              <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before your appointment</h2>
                <p>To get ready:<p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>decide where you’ll sit, it should be a space that's quiet and private</li>
                  <li>let anyone who shares the space with you know, so you're not interrupted</li>
                  <li>make sure the device you’ll use is fully charged or plugged in, so you do not get cut off during the appointment</li>
                  <li>be ready 10 minutes before the start time</li>
                  <li>test the equipment, so you know it works</li>
                  <li>sit with light in front of you, so your face is not in shadow</li>
                  <li>make sure we can see your face and shoulders</li>
                </ul>
              <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">During your appointment</h2>
                <p>When your camera is on, you’ll be seen at all times, whether you’re speaking or not.
                  This includes if you change to another tab, or on some devices, even if you lock your screen.</p>

                <p>If you experience any issues with the picture or sound during the appointment, try the 'Refresh' button.
                  In most cases this should fix the problem.</p>

                <p> If you close your browser or lose connection before the end of your appointment, you can use the 'Attend your video appointment' link again to rejoin.</p>
              <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to join a video appointment</h2>
              <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                <li>Select the ‘Attend your video appointment’ link within 10 minutes of your appointment start time.</li>
                <li>You will be asked for use of your camera and microphone. You must choose 'Allow' to take part in the video appointment.</li>
                <li>You should then see the other person and a small window showing yourself. If you do not see the other person, please wait for them to join.</li>

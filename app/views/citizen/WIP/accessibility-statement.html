              <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
                <p>DWP is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

              <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" style="font-size: 27px">Compliance status</h2>
                <p>This website is fully compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard.</p>
                <p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to [insert one of the following: ‘the non-compliances’, ‘the exemptions’ or ‘the non-compliances and exemptions’] listed below.</p>
                <p>This website is not compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard. The [insert one of the following: ‘non-compliances’, ‘exemptions’ or ‘non-compliances and exemptions’] are listed below.</p>

              <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h2>
                <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

              <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" style="font-size: 27px">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>
                <p>Some images do not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).</p>
                <p>We plan to add text alternatives for all images by September 2020. When we publish new content we’ll make sure our use of images meets accessibility standards.</p>

              <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" style="font-size: 27px">Disproportionate burden</h2>

              <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Navigation and accessing information</h3>
                <p>There’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main content’ option).</p>
                <p>It’s not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content.</p>
                <p>It’s not possible for users to change text size without some of the content overlapping.</p>

              <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" style="font-size: 27px">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h2>
              <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Live video</h3>
                <p>We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made">exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations</a>.

              <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
                <p>Our accessibility roadmap [add link to roadmap] shows how and when we plan to improve accessibility on this website.</p>
